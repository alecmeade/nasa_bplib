The code in this directory is branched from [nasa/bplib](https://github.com/nasa/bplib), 
a NASA open source library for implmenting the Bundle Protocol V6 for Delay Tolerant Networks. 
The code that was extracted from the /common and /unittest directories in the original repository
represents work from Alexander Norton Meade's internship at NASA GSFC in 2019. This repository 
is merely used to document that work. All code in this repository cannot be licensed without
